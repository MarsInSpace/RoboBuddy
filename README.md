# RoboBuddy

This is a game developed in a Unity and C# programming course within the BA Game Design I am doing.  
The assets are not mine but were provided by the professor.  

## The concept

The idea was to learn different implementations of ingame character creation and working with rotations to create a fun little game.  

## Have a look!

This repository contains the entire Unity project, NOT the build.  
To play, run the Unity Editor and play inside it.
